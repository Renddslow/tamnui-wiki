## Phonology

### Consonants

Because of the anatomy of avianoids, articulation is limited to a handful of regions in the inner beak. The chart below demonstrates the distinct sounds, however they approximated to humanoid mouths for the sake of approximated human pronunciation. As it is, avianoids have neither a soft palate nor an alveolar ridge. However, different features of the inner beak produce close-enough points of articulation to create sounds nigh indiscernible to most ears as described in the chart below.

|  | Dental (Nail/Tip) | Alveolar | Palatal | Velar | Glottal |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| **Nasal** | n̥ | n | ɲ | ŋ |  |
| **Plosive** | t |  | c | k | ʔ |
| **Affricate** |  | ts |  |  |  |
| **Fricative** | θ | s   | ɕ | ɣ | h |
| **Approximant** |  |  |  | j |  |

## Grammar

Hahakâ is a VSO language.

Hahakâ distinguishes two numbers, and four noun cases: direct, vocative, locative, and instrumental. 

|  | Direct | Vocative | Locative | Instrumental |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Singular |  | -ɛ˨˦ | -ɛn˨˦ | -a˩ |
| Plural | -a˥˩ | -ət˥˩ | -an˨˦ | -a˩nə˧˩ |
Each of these can also stand alone as particles when needed.

Gender is marked analytically, typically following the noun it modifies. The absence of a gender marker indicate neuter or inanimate.

|  | Masculine | Feminine |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Singular | ŋâh | ɲǎh |
| Plural | ŋâkah | ɲǎkah |
### Verb Paradigms

Because gender is marked through a standalone lexeme, verbs only mark for number and person within their class and aspect.

|  | Perf. | Imp. | Jussive | Imperative |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 3rd person singular | kjêt | **ye**kjêt | **ye**kjêt |  |
| 2nd person singular | kjêt**kha** | **te**kjêt | **te**kjêt | **te**kjêt**kjêt** |
| 1st person singular | kjêt**at** | **e**kjêt | **e**kjêt**ah** |  |
| 3rd person plural | kjêt**as** | **ye**kjêt**as** | **ye**kjêt**as** |  |
| 2nd person plural | kjêt**khěn ** | **te**kjêt**as** | **te**kjêt**as** | **te**kjêt**kjêtas** |
| 1st person plural | kjêt**nāj** | **n̥e**kjêt | **n̥e**kjêt**ah** |  |

| Infinitive |
| ---- |
| kjêt**kjêt** |
**Note**: It may not be immediately obvious, but imperatives and infinitives duplicate the root (3rd singular) and attach 2nd person preformatives and sufformatives.

| Singular | **ne**kjêt**a** |

## North Wind Translation

| Line | Interlinear |
| ---- | ---- |
| 1 | The North Wind and the Sun were disputing which was the stronger when a traveler came along wrapped in a warm cloak. |
|  | Cejâɲas kânǎn ka̋ɣash et kâsh et cejâɲas ǎn e'at ke yehen ɣǎkân e'at nah et ha̋j ke jǎŋ ka̋ɣah ŋâh hatkasah ŋâh te ɣǎɣat nekanaha. |
| 2 | They agreed that the one who first succeeded in making the traveler take his cloak off should be considered stronger than the other. |
|  | Nejâcas ke ɣanah nah te neɣanaha e'at te netaaha hâseh ka̋ɣah ɣǎɣat es ŋâh ke yeha̋j aheh e'at nen asheh. |
| 3 | Then the North Wind blew as hard as he could, but the more he blew the more closely did the traveler fold his cloak around him; |
|  | Et ha̋j ke nǎn kânǎn ka̋ɣash te kaheh ɣǎ et neke nǎn ŋâh kathas athas ŋâh hatnetehneteh ɣǎɣat es ŋâh. |
| 4 | and at last the North Wind gave up the attempt. Then the Sun shined out warmly, and immediately the traveler took off his cloak. |
|  | Et te atah takâk te netaaha kânǎn ka̋ɣash et ha̋j shesh te nekanaha kâsh et najat hâseh ka̋ɣah ɣǎɣat es ŋâh. |
| 5 | And so the North Wind was obliged to confess that the Sun was the stronger of the two. |
|  | Et ha̋j ȁnas naɣâtnaɣât kânǎn ka̋ɣash ke hen ɣǎkân kâsh nen she'at. |
