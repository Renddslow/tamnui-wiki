About the time when [[Dwarf]] began digging and [[Halfling]] began farming and Human began to set his hand to war, [[Pisteth]] saw that [[Geneshhi]], and [[Lover]], and [[Early-Grave]] had not given to them wives. And he saw that all the creatures of the land were not like Dwarf or Halfling or Human, for they could not reason nor be industrious.

So Pisteth sat on [[Har Moed|the mountain where the gods meet]] until the three sisters passed him by. Now it was about this time that the three sisters would [[War of the Three Sisters|go to war]], for Human had killed one of the sons of Halfling and had begun to make war upon the land. Now when the sisters passed by Pisteth on the mountain where the gods meet, he said to them, "Turn aside and let us take counsel."

But they said to him, "We must not, for we are about to go to war."

And Pisteth said, "But there is a matter of great importance in all the earth, and I urgently desire your counsel." But they did not listen to his words, and so they [[War of the Three Sisters|went to war]]. So Pisteth said, "Therefore I shall take counsel in myself about what I am going to do about the creatures on the earth."

Now one night, Halfling and Dwarf were feasting with their children but the Human did not feast, and so was not found. And Pisteth came down and stole away each one in the night. And he cast a spell on each one so that they would be duplicated and fashioned like the women of the creatures which were not industrious and could not reasonâ€”in that they could conceive and also bear children and also be women according to the manner of womanhood.

Now when Halfling and Dwarf saw their counterparts, who were women according to the manner of womanhood, they shouted in delight, saying, "A she! A she is given to me." Therefore women are called "she." And Halfling and Dwarf lived with their wives, and they had many children.
