> Scholar's Note: The exact dating of the mass migration of the proto-Goblinoid species into the southwestern continent is a matter of considerable debate. The earliest attested records of Goblin material culture are as late as 6,500 BME, with Hobgoblin writing first appearing in 4,500 BME. 
> There is an old fragment of an [[Em La'ar Malar poem|Ancient Mousefolk poem]], dated around 9,600 BME which may be contemporary with the events described in this story, though it is hard to be certain.
