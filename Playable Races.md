Any of the [[Prime-Native Species]] are playable. In addition, any of the [[Lauds-Migratory Species]] are playable races. Each of those articles provide information on those races with links to histories, mythologies, and pantheons. For helpful reference, below is a list of races from the Character Builder in D&D Beyond that **ARE NOT PLAYABLE**. 

The list is divided into two segments, the first is races which are not playable because those races do not exist in this campaign setting. The second are house-rule constraints because they are common low-level enemies or they just don't fit the vibe.
