When [[War of the Three Sisters|the war of the three sisters]] had grown quite severe in the skies and on the land, and after the first Human had ascended to become [[War (god)]], [[Weaver]], the wife of [[Geneshhi]] sat on [[Har Moed|the mountain where the gods meet]], because she was scheming. And when [[Wise-Hammer]] passed that way, she called out to him, "Turn aside, lord, and let us take counsel."

But [[Wise-Hammer]] said to her, "I must not, for the war has grown quite severe in the skies and on the land."

And [[Weaver]] said, "But there is a matter of great importance in all the earth, and I urgently desire your counsel." So [[Wise-Hammer]] heeded the voice of [[Weaver]], the wife of [[Geneshhi]], and he sat down and they held counsel.

And [[Weaver]] said to [[Wise-Hammer]], "The matter of the war is concerning to all the gods and to all creatures upon the land. For Human and his sons have learned war, and [[War (god)]] is great now in the skies. Therefore, let us make two wives, one to govern the sons of Human and one to govern [[War (god)]]."

But [[Wise-Hammer]] said, "It is not in my power to create a goddess. I may only make those who correspond to one another upon the land. And how could I make one whom [[War (god)]] would find lovely?"

But [[Weaver]] considered that [[Wise-Hammer]] could make someone comparable in wisdom to himself and comparable in beauty to [[Lover]].  Therefore she said, "Two wives you shall make, and two companions for those on the land and those in the skies. They shall, each one, be comparable in wisdom to yourself and comparable in beauty to [[Lover]]. Then [[Mem]] will look upon these two and will say, 'Surely this one shall be the mother of all the Humans upon the land and this one shall be wife to [[War (god)]] in the skies.'"

And [[Wise-Hammer]] saw that [[Weaver]] had devised cleverly. Therefore, for forty-four days [[Wise-Hammer]] crafted two women with all of the wisdom he could devise and all the industriousness he could craft. And on the forty-fourth day, behold, two wise women. [[Wise-Hammer]] tested them in all manner of wisdom and knowledge, and in craft and in all industriousness. When he saw that they were very wise, he put them into a deep slumber and labored another forty-four days in his crafting. Therefore [[Wise-Hammer]] crafter two women with all of the beauty of [[Lover]] and all of the elegance of [[Geneshhi]]. And on the forty-fourth day from his making, behold, two beautiful women. 

Now [[Weaver]] took the woman meant for the sons of Human and gave her to the sons of Human. And the sons of Human looked upon her in wonder and said, "Behold, this woman is beautiful. She shall be a great prize to come home to at the end of all of our warring." And they were each eager to marry her.

On the morning after their wedding, the son of Human arose to go out to war, but his woman arose with him and said to him, "Where do you go off to?" And he said, "To make war upon the land so that I may eat, for the sound of my stomach is in my ears."

But she said to him, "Why do you make war? Arise! Become industrious. Produce food from the ground." Therefore the son of Human's voice was shut up in his throat, for he could not counter the wisdom and beauty of his woman. From that day on, the sons of Human would plant and harvest in the field like the sons of Halfling. And whenever he would wish to go to war, he would first go to his wife to seek her counsel. And if she would tell him not to go to war, he would not go. And if she told him he should fight, he would fight.

Therefore there was peace in the land.

And [[Wise-Hammer]] brought the second woman to [[Har Moed|the mountain where the gods meet]]. And they sat there until [[Mem]] passed by. And when it came about that [[Mem]] passed by, [[Wise-Hammer]] arose and called out to [[Mem]], saying, "Turn aside, lord, and behold, a woman great in beauty and exceeding in wisdom." But [[Mem]] did not heed his words.

Now after forty-four day, [[Wise-Hammer]] and the second woman were still seated on the mountain where the gods meet. And it came about that [[Mem]] passed by. And [[Wise-Hammer]] arose and called out to [[Mem]], saying, "Turn aside, lord, and behold, a woman cunning and lovely to look upon." But [[Mem]] did not heed his words.

Now it happened on a third interval of forty-four days, when [[Wise-Hammer]] and the second woman were still dwelling on the mountain where the gods meet that [[Mem]] chanced to pass by a third time. And the woman arose and called out to [[Mem]], saying, "My lord, how lovely is your countenance and so shrewd your dealings." And [[Mem]] turned aside to look upon the woman. And behold, she was exceedingly beautiful.

And [[Mem]] said to her, "How have you come here, to the place where the gods are?" 
And she said, "All who desire wisdom come to sit at the feet of [[Mem]]." 
[[Mem]] said to her, "I am indeed great in wisdom, and able to make all things. Therefore, what wisdom do you seek from me."
She said, "My lord, [[Wise-Hammer]] is truly masterful in all that he does, crafting works of fine beauty and teaching all manner of creature the wisdom which comes from [[Mem]]. But my lord, there is one thing which he cannot teach, and which know man can learn."
And [[Mem]] asked, "What is this thing?"
She said, "How a god might love a woman, and how a woman might become wife to a god. For I am desirous in my heart and in my loins to be joined to [[War (god)]] that I may be his counsel."
And [[Mem]] saw that she was fair beautiful and crafty, and that her hands were industrious and good for teaching wisdom. And he saw that the war in the skies had been long upon the skies. And so he said to her, "Behold, only [[Mem]] alone has this knowledge, and [[Mem]] alone shall keep it. But this shall I do for you. I shall make you a goddess, that you may win the heart of [[War (god)]] and that you may be his counsel. For you desire him in your heart and in your loins, and his war is long upon the skies."

And the second woman became a goddess because of the desire in her loins. Therefore is she called [[Lady Loins]] to this day.
