Now it came about that the goddesses [[Geneshhi]], [[Lover]], and [[Early-Grave]] each desired to rule over the [[Southern Continent]]. They decided on a test. Each would pick one from among the dwellers of the Southern Continent. Then they would have their uncle, [[Pisteth]], draw up a fair race. Whichever among them chose the creature who ran the race the swiftest, she would be the ruler of the continent.

Even though [[Pisteth]]'s course was fair and wise, the three sisters each desired an upper-hand. [[Lover]] took for herself a creature and called him [[Human]]. She enlarged his shoulders, straightened his back, and expanded his lungs, saying that he could run faster and longer than all others. [[Geneshhi]] took for herself a creature and called him [[Halfling]]. She shortened his stature and made him nimble of foot, saying that he could outwit and out-dance all others. [[Early-Grave]] took for herself a creature and called him Dwarf. She made him stocky and short, with great big hands and a hardy nose, saying that he could out-dig all others. Therefore, she said that he could dig a straighter course than [[Pisteth]] had devised, and win for her the Southern Continent.

And while each goddess remade each their creature in their image, they had not given him wisdom. Therefore, when [[Pisteth]] said, "Go!" Each one took off in a different direction. 

Dwarf began digging, and did not stop until he had come to the very roots of the great southern mountain range. When he had come their, he began to build himself a home, saying, "I do not very much like running. I shall abide here and take a wife and acquire wealth." And so Dwarf did just that. He built an underground fortress, and he created mines and mining. And every dwarf who ever was came from Dwarf.

Halfling ran only a few paces before deciding that he should much rather settle down, plant a garden, and drink brandy. And so Halfling did just that. He planted a garden in the north and he created farms and farming. And every Halfling who ever was came from Halfling.

Human ran and he did not stop. He also did not concern himself with the course set out by [[Pisteth]]. Instead he ran straight to the northern hill country until he met the [[Tamnui Sea]]. When he saw that he could go no further, he began to consider that he was very hungry. And he said to himself, "I am not a digger like Dwarf nor am I a farmer like Halfling. How shall I eat and become great upon the land?"

[[Pisteth]] saw that Human had no food and that he could not farm or dig, and therefore was very hungry. 

And [[Pisteth]] said to Human, "Why do you sit there? Is not your stomach quite hungry?" 
And Human answered, "Indeed, I am very hungry, and all my bones ache for food."
And [[Pisteth]] said, "Then why do you sit there? Arise! Become industrious. Produce food from the land."

But as [[Pisteth]] said these things, [[The Master]] said to the Human, "What have you to be industrious for? Do you not see that your brother, Halfling and your brother Dwarf toil all day and do not enjoy life? Therefore, take you from all that they create so that you may be filled and your children may eat." But [[Pisteth]] did not know that [[The Master]] told Human these things, for he said them to his heart. 

And so Human took a rock, and became very industrious with it, and he made it into a spear-tip. And he went down to the farms of Halfling and his sons. And when he came down to Halfling and his sons, one of the sons of Halfling looked, and behold, Human was coming to greet him. And he said, "May the grace of [[Geneshhi]] be with you, brother." But Human did not hear him, because the sound of his stomach was in his ears. 

And he stabbed the son of Halfling three times in the belly until he died. Then he took from all that was in the field which belonged to the son of Halfling, and he ate, and he was satisfied for a little while. 

Then Human took a wife and had many children. And he taught them to be industrious with the bow, and with the club, and with the spear. And he taught them war upon the land.
