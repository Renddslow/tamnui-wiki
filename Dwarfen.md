## Phonology

**Consonants**

The plosives and fricatives of each place of articulation are technically allophones, as they are employed differently based on the position inside of a syllable. Dwarfen will always prefer plosives in the onset and fricatives in the coda.

## Orthography
Dwarfen script developed initially in the southern mountains as a consonantal language. Runes were developed to represent most of the significant consonantal sounds with only one digraph (s/sh). It is likely that /s/ and /ʀ/ were initially allophones, but overtime grew to be distinguished as separate consonants.
