## Grammar

**Conjunctions**

Simple conjunctions are produced by placing the consonant /n/ on the front of the word. This becomes a syllabic consonant, vocalized as /nə/.

Ugatoti also provides three complex conjunctions, one for disjunctions, one for serialization and counting, and the last for poetry.

**Disjunctions**

Complex disjunctions in Ugatoti take two forms. The first is in the absolute form: /o/. This is common in legal documents and more formal speech when explicit definition of contrasts are warranted and the risk of relying on context is seen as problematic.

The second is when attaching a simple conjunction to the contrastive preposition: /nəkə/. Therefore, if we wished to communicate the sentence, "He wished to dance with the king or the queen" we could communicate it in one of these three forms:

1. /wetnataŋ ɛt-ʃaru o ʃarut/
2. /wetnataŋ ɛt-ʃaru nəkəʃarut/
3. /wetnataŋ ɛt-ʃaru nəʃarut/
