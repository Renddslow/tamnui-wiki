Formerly a chaotic, primordial force, likely the result of the wrestlings of [[Ashur-Azher]] and [[Loshur-Telim]], Shemsharu was [[Binding of Shemsharu|bound up]] by the three brothers, [[Prime (deity)]], [[Jotun (deity)]], and [[Lauds (deity)]]. Shemsharu now hangs as the chief star of the [[Prime system]] and gives light to all three spheres in the day-time.

## History
Shemsharu's origin is unclear. The [[Ugati]] people reject the existence of Shemsharu at all, though most pantheons include Shemsharu as part of their particular chaoskampf. Using the tools of comparative religion, scholars and sages belief Shemsharu to have been the result of the many battles and wrestling matches of [[Ashur-Azher]] and [[Loshur-Telim]].
