Formerly a chaotic, primordial force, likely the result of the wrestlings of [[Ashur-Azher]] and [[Loshur-Telim]], Shemsharu was [[Binding of Shemsharu|bound up]] by the three brothers, [[Prime (deity)]], [[Jotun (deity)]], and [[Lauds (deity)]]. Shemsharu now hangs as the chief star of the [[Prime system]] and gives light to all three spheres in the day-time.
