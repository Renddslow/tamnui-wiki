## Grammar

### Prepositions

In Ancient Mousefolk, prepositions are prefixed at the beginning of the word they modify. 

- ל - belonging
- פ - locative/temporal
- ק - comparative

### Morality Sufformatives

The character מ can attach to the front of a word and shift the moral disposition of the word's presentation. For instance, a person might be לָר (just), but if they were מְלָר, they would be unjust.
