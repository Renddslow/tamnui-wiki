The Prime Humanoid (or **PHLUCA**) is the term given to the last universal common ancestor of three of the major [[Prime-Native Species]] of sentient beings. 

Scholars debate whether or not PHLUCA was more closely related to modern humans, with halflings and dwarves branching off of humans, or whether PHLUCA was more unique, with the three races equally having been branches. Whatever the case, scholars and sages refer to this divine incursion as [[The Branching]]. 
## Origin

PHLUCA seems to have primarily evolved in the southern continent prior to the Branching. Roughly [[45,000 BME|45,000 years before the modern era]], PHLUCA was living in the southern continent and had not yet begun farming nor—scholars assume—created fire. They were likely living in family groups, and it is quite possible that they had just begun choosing life-long mates. It was at this point when the three sisters, [[Geneshhi]], [[Lover]], and [[Early-Grave]] [[The Branching|branched PHLUCA]] into three races.
