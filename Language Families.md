## Prime

The Prime Sphere has four surviving language families.
### Avianoid Language Family

### Gliresoid Language Family

The languages spoken primarily by woodland beast-men. The earliest common language was the theorized Proto-Southwestern-Gliresoid. This gave way to much attested Rabbitfolk, spoken by early civilizations of Harengon.

Ancient Mousefolk is well attested in art and literature, though it no longer has speakers. While it is clearly influenced by Ancient Rabbitfolk, it shares features with an unattested common ancestor of Ancient Satyr.

Ancient Satyr has undergone a resurgence through the influence of [[The Shepherds]]—a nomadic, Satyr people-group who primarily sojourn on the [[Northshore]]. It has not undergone serious development, though sociologists and linguists suspect that in a few hundred years it will naturally give way to a Modern Satyr which is influenced by its ancient parent and Northshore Common.

Rabbitfolk dominance has led to two distinct dialects and an imperial tradelanguage. East Rabbitfolk is most commonly associated with high art, politics, and scholarship, while Central Rabbitfolk is the more common—among Harengon and Mousefolk—dialect. Due to the enslavement of Goblins and Hobgoblins by the upperclass of the Rabbitfolk Empire, Modern Goblinoid has undergone serious adaptation.

Ancient Mousefolk is still used occasionally in certain cultic practices, like in the worship of [[Field Mouse Mother]] and [[Black Cat]], but otherwise is merely a cultural artifact of Mousefolk culture.

### Southern Continental Language Family

Humanoids [[Prime Humanoid|evolved on the southern continent]] over tens of thousands of years. Southern neolithic was the language spoken by the ancient cousins of PHLUCA. These creatures eventually devolved into the [[Goblinoid (genus)|Goblinoid genus]] through the [[How the Goblins Came to Be|influence]] of [[The Master]] and [[Early-Grave]].

### Theriaoid

Somewhere around the time of the [[Northern Changing]], the Proto-Theriaoid language began to be spoken by all bi-pedal, land-dwelling beast-men in the northern continent.

As the three races became isolated from one another and moving into different climate zones, they developed distinctive languages over the course of thousands of years. Eventually, Centaurs and Northern Humans would develop close relations and a language influenced by both Northshore Common and Centaur developed.
